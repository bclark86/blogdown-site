### Ethos
Observe. Experiment. Fail. Learn. Repeat.

For me, it’s just about delivering an exceptional human experience through the use of data, technology, and empathy — earning the right to business growth by improving the lives of your customers. 

### Interests

I am a problem-solver at heart. I think the best experiences are the natural outcome of a well designed solution.  

Whether you call it business analytics, advanced analytics, or data science, I love the game of driving customer (and subsequently business) value through data-informed/driven problem-solving. Some of my favorite techniques are regression methods, experimentation, Monte Carlo simulation, and machine learning. That said, I am all for whatever method is going to maximize ROI for my stakeholders. 

In another lifetime, I might have been a behavioral scientist as I am fascinated by how people develop preferences, create and change habits, and interact with the world around them. I think a blend of multiple methods leads to the best insights; quantitative informs the what, qualitative contextualizes the why, and together, they lead to creating better experiences. 

### Education

I am working on an MBA from NYU Stern where my focus is on Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Tech Product Management and Economics. I am also a VP and board member for the Business Analytics Club where my primary goal is to find ways to help students learn the skills necessary to career pivot and/or elevate within their current roles. 

Prior to my MBA, I completed in a Master's in Applied Business Analytics from Boston University and a Bachelor's in Marketing from Santa Clara University. In between, while exploring career pivots, I completed an EMT certification from San Diego Miramar College (though never used it formally).
