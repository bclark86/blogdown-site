      <description>Ethos Observe. Experiment. Fail. Learn. Repeat.
For me, it’s just about delivering an exceptional human experience through the use of data, technology, and empathy — earning the right to business growth by improving the lives of your customers.
Interests I am a problem-solver at heart. I think the best experiences are the natural outcome of a well designed solution.
Whether you call it business analytics, advanced analytics, or data science, I love the game of driving customer (and subsequently business) value through data-informed/driven problem-solving.</description>
